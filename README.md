# AI-Powered-Math-Question-Chatbot
# Math Question Solver Chatbot

## Overview

Welcome to the Math Question Solver Chatbot! This project demonstrates a chatbot built using Python that can assist school students in solving math questions. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained transformer-based model to understand and respond to math queries.

## Features

- **Question Understanding**: The chatbot can comprehend a variety of math questions, including those related to profit, area, interest, distance, and more.
- **Step-by-Step Solutions**: It provides detailed solutions and explanations to help users understand the problem-solving process.
- **Easy Interaction**: Users can simply input their questions and receive accurate answers without the need for complex commands.

## How It Works

1. The chatbot reads and understands math questions from a dataset.
2. It categorizes questions into topics based on keywords.
3. Users input their questions, and the chatbot predicts and provides answers along with explanations using a transformer-based model.

## Example Usage

- **User Input**: "What is the profit percentage for the manufacturer?"
- **Chatbot Response**: "The profit percentage for the manufacturer is 20%. This means they earn 20% profit on the cost price."
- **Explanation**: The chatbot predicts the answer and explains the concept of profit percentage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `transformers`).
3. Run the provided Python script to interact with the chatbot and test its capabilities.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve question categorization for a wider range of topics.
- Implement a more interactive and user-friendly interface.
